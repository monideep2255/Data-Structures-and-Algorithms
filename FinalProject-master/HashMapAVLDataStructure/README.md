# CS5008 Final Project: HashMap AVL Data Structure

HashMap AVL Data Structure to solve the problem: **What is an efficient way to store all this data and query it without a bad time complexity?**</br>

There are 2 folders and 3 files for the assignment:</br>

## Folders:</br>
**AVL:** folder for all the files related to implementation of the AVL tree.</br>

**HashMap:** folder for all the files related to the implementation of the AVL tree</br>

## Files:</br>
**HashMapAVL.h:** The header file with all the structs and function signature for the combined data structure.</br>

**HashMapAVL.c:** The file with the implementation for the data structure</br>

**HashMapAVLMain_clock.c:** The file to run the implementation along with the clock function to test performance.</br>
