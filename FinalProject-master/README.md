### Context of project:

Four of us are developing a startup where we have a use case to capture the user data
we obtain from our platform and use it for various activities. Two of the main activities
where we are planning to use this data to start with is for targeted marketing and
mapping, searching, filtering various users by demographics for a data driven
approach to our decision making. This brings us to the two problems we are trying to
solve.

### Problem Statement:
- What is an efficient way to store all this data and query it without a bad time
complexity?</br>
- What is the best way to strategize marketing using our data?
